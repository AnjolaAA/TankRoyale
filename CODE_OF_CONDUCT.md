# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
 advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

  ## Expectations from Team Members 
 
**Unable to Attend Team Meetings**
Person should make it known 24 hours before the meeting but have points/topics for discussion. 
The group will carry-on as planned and leave comments for you to access later. 
Should have no hindrance on meeting future deadlines. 

**Problems Finishing or Handling Code** 
Ask Architect or Code Repository Manager for assistance at least 48 hours before next meeting 
Be sure to keep the group members informed of when help was needed and when and who found a solution.

**No Verbal Contributions During the Meeting**
Ensure you at the very least understand what the group is discussing 
Ensure your code is functioning
Ensure you are comfortable with what is being presented 
Communicate with Team Lead or Communications Manager privately if you do not feel comfortable sharing with the group

**Taking Over the Meeting With Personal Ideas or Anecdotes**
The Communications Manager will deal with you accordingly
The Team Lead will get involved if need be 
You may be asked to present your ideas in a more structure format to ensure time is available for all members to contribute (ex. Email or text) 

**Detection of Incorrect, Undocumented, or Weak Code**
Shall be addressed during our weekly code review. 
The Architect and Code repository Managers will make decisions on the optimal action for the code.
If revisions are necessary, the team member in question will edit it alongside someone with more knowledge (typically the Architect).
Proper documentation and commenting is a must for any and all code written. 


## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at . All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
